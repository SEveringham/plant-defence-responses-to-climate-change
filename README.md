# plant-defence-responses-to-climate-change

This respository contains code for analysis from the manuscript: Everingham, Salminen, Sabot and Moles (In Prep), Plant defence traits show limited responses to climate change.

There are 5 files:
1. https://github.com/SEveringham/plant-defence-responses-to-climate-change/blob/main/reshaping%20data%20for%20defenses%20analysis.Rmd
Which shows the organisation of data to use for further analyses

2. https://github.com/SEveringham/plant-defence-responses-to-climate-change/blob/main/two%20way%20defense%20and%20means%20analysis.Rmd
Which contains the analysis of all defence trait changes regression against changes in mean temperature and precipitation

3. https://github.com/SEveringham/plant-defence-responses-to-climate-change/blob/main/PCA%20defenses.Rmd
This Rmd contains code to extract the PCA for overall defences

4. https://github.com/SEveringham/plant-defence-responses-to-climate-change/blob/main/analysing%20all%20traits%20comparatively.Rmd
This code analyses all changes in defence traits (as well as overall defences calculated in the PCA above) again all changes in climate metrics using a multi-model selction method with a meta-analysis framework

5. https://github.com/SEveringham/plant-defence-responses-to-climate-change/blob/main/analysing%20all%20traits%20comparatively.Rmd
Finally, this code has the analysis of the absolute differences in trait changes against the absolute differences in changes in morphological traits and physiological traits (which were extracted in analysis in previous projects: https://github.com/SEveringham/regeneration-and-growth-plant-trait-responses-to-climate-change and https://github.com/SEveringham/leaf-trait-responses-to-climate-change)
